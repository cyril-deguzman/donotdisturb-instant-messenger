## Requirements

Make sure these libraries, packages, and extensions are installed

1. Node.js
   Use node version 16.18.0 for consistency. the package expo-cli doesn't support node versions greater than 16.x (Gallium) yet.

2. yarn
   yarn is used all throughout the project to install packages, npm can be used but not fit for production when you plan to fork this project.

   Install yarn

   ```shell
   npm install --global yarn
   ```

3. expo-cli
   Expo CLI is a command-line tool that is the primary interface between a developer and other Expo tools. You are going to use it for different tasks in the development life cycle of your project such as serving the project in development, viewing logs, opening the app on an emulator or a physical device, and so on.

   Install expo-cli

   ```
   yarn global add expo-cli
   ```
