## Screens need to be sorted accordingly.

1. Migrate all screens connected to "Settings"
2. Double check thoroughly all the functions before making a pull request.
3. Settings.js should be renamed "index.js" when placed under this directory. Refer to ./screens/Home/index.js they should work in the same manner.
